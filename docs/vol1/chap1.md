# Creating your first app

Creating apps can be difficult, but with ScriptBlocks, it is way easier to create apps from scratch. Here's how you do it:

First, open your ScriptBlocks project, if applicable. Then, look at the main pane in the middle - that's where we are going to type our code. Next, type the following code - this is basic boilerplate code for our app:

```py
import scriptblocks

app = scriptblocks.App({

})
```
