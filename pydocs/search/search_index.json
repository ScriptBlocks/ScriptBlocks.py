Here's how you do it:</p> <p>First, open your ScriptBlocks project, if applicable. Then, look at the main pane in the middle - that's where we are going to type our code. Next, type the following code - this is basic boilerplate code for our app:</p> Python<pre><code>import scriptblocks\n\napp = scriptblocks.App()\napp.name = \"My first app!\"\napp.version = \"v1.0.0-alpha.1\"\napp.author = \"OmgRod\"\n\napp.render()\n</code></pre> <p>Let's go through the code now:</p> <ul> <li>Line 3 initialises the app</li> <li>Lines 4-6 set the info about the app</li> <li>Line 8 creates the app window</li> </ul> <p>This is it for creating apps so now, let's move on to Object Management.</p>"},{"location":"vol1/chap2/","title":"Object Management","text":"<p>Now that we have created our app, we need to put stuff inside it. So, here's how:</p> <p>We have a method in the App class called <code>App().objects</code>. This is a class embedded in a class, however we cannot initialise it. We can only call functions in it. Here are the functions we can call in it:</p> Python<pre><code>from scriptblocks import App, Sprite\n\napp = App()\n\ntestSprite = Sprite(\"image.png\")\n\napp.objects.add(testSprite.getRaw())\n</code></pre>"}]}
